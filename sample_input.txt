I absolutely loved the new movie! The story was engaging and the actors did a fantastic job.
However, the ending was a bit disappointing and left me wanting more.
Overall, it was a good experience and I would recommend it to my friends.
The popcorn was stale and the seats were uncomfortable, but the visuals made up for it.
